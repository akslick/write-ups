    "There are a lot of great blogging platforms out there, and I know it's all the rage these days to have your website hosted on github and push new pages directly from your repository. However, for those of us stuck in the stone age using platforms like Wordpress, there hasn't been as much talk about using newfangled tools like the Jupyter (IPython) Notbebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, it's relatively simple to convert jupyter notebooks into a format that can be used in something like Wordpress. This is a quick tutorial on how I got it working for this site. So without further ado...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0 - Write content into your notebook\n",
    "You can use markdown cells, code cells, whatever. It's also fine if you leave outputs in the notebook as well. The only caveat is that if you're hard-linking to things that are on your computer, then it won't be rendered when you put it on the internet unless you update the links too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1 - Download the notebook file\n",
    "You can download your notebook file directly to your computer by going to File -> Download as -> Ipython Notebook. (note, this might be Jupyter Notebook one day).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download an `.ipynb` file to your computer, which contains \n",
    "all of the information in your original interactive notebook. Importantly - any images, plots, etc will be serialized and store with the notebook itself, which means you can still display them later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2 - Convert the notebook to an html file\n",
    "For this, `nbconvert` is a magnificent tool. Check out their instructions for using it [here](https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/notebook/nbconvert.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a notebook for HTML, run `nbconvert` with the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ipython nbconvert --to html --template basic *source_file.ipynb* *target_file.html*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make note of the `basic` command - this strips a lot of the fancy shmancy ipython formatting and just gives you the basic tags etc. This is important because we'll just create our own styles in wordpress, which brings me to...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3 - Add notebook styles to your site CSS file\n",
    "There are a few typical tags that nbconvert will output, and you can capture these tags to style notebooks however you like. Go to your custom CSS file in wordpress, and add the following tags to mimic what this site does:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",

    "## Step 4 - Turn off `p` and `br` tags in wordpress (maybe)\n",
    "I'm not sure why this is, but I had trouble with Wordpress automatically creating these tags when I pasted in my notebook HTML code. You can turn these off by adding the following lines to your `functions.php` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```php\n",
    "// Disable automatic p and br tags\n",
    "remove_filter( 'the_content', 'wpautop' );\n",
    "remove_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'wpautop' );\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's possible that this won't be an issue for you, so I'd say only try this if these tags seem to be a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4.1 - Get mathjax working on your wordpress install\n",
    "Mathjax is really useful for displaying mathematical equations, notation, etc that are often used in notebooks. Check out the [Automatic mathjax plugin](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/v1.1-latest/platforms/wordpress.html) and see [this stackexchange post](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27633/mathjax-inline-mode-not-rendering) on getting it set up correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5 - Paste in the HTML to a new post\n",
    "Now we're ready to create the new post in wordpress. On the post editing page, switch the editor view to 'Text'. Then, open up your newly-created HTML file in a text editor of your choice. Copy the entire thing, then paste it all into the 'Text' window. It'll look like gibberish, but if your CSS is done right, it should all \"just work\".\n",
    "\n",
    "# That's it\n",
    "You're ready to post to your blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are a lot of things you could tweak here (most obviously the CSS that styles your notebooks). This is just a starting point, but I've found it sufficient to create notebook posts that don't look like garbage. I hope you find it useful!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remember\n",
    "Here a few quick 'gotchas' that I ran into. Keep these in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you hard-link to any images or files on your computer, make sure that you upload these to your website and link to them in the code, otherwise the links may break. If you're plotting the images w/ data in the notebook itself, it should serialize the images and won't be a problem.\n",
    "* I'd highly recommend keeping a version of the post as a notebook on Github anyway. It's a great way to keep track of your drafts, and the conversion process above is pretty painless in case you need to make changes.\n",
    "* If you display images within a text cell, it may appear inline with your text. In that case, just split the cell up into multiple ones, and give the image its own cell so it's displayed correctly.\n",
    "* You may want to match your website content container width to roughly the same width that ipython notebooks use to display, this will keep the output more natural-looking\n",
    "* *Note - this is largely inspired by a post I found [here](http://prooffreaderplus.blogspot.com/2014/11/how-to-quickly-turn-ipython-notebook.html). Check it out for more ideas*"
